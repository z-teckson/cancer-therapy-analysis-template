## Data Preparation Steps

1. **Source data**: Obtain de-identified clinical trial data or publicly available datasets.
2. **Data cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize formats.
3. **Data transformation**: Create derived variables (e.g., response categories, survival times).
4. **Data validation**: Check for consistency and accuracy.
