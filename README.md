# Cancer Therapy Analysis Template

A structured, reproducible workflow for analyzing clinical data on new cancer treatments (e.g., nanoparticle therapy) compared to existing treatments. This template guides junior researchers through the research process, from literature review to drafting a summary of findings, while incorporating discussions on screening controversies.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets (de-identified).
- `scripts/`: Data analysis and visualization scripts.
- `docs/`: Documentation, literature reviews, and final report.
- `results/`: Generated plots, tables, and analysis outputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the checklist of issues in the Issues tab to complete each step.
3. Use the provided templates in the `docs/` directory to document your work.
4. Run analysis scripts in `scripts/` and save outputs to `results/`.
5. Draft the final report summarizing findings.

## Purpose

This template aims to standardize and streamline cancer therapy efficacy analysis, ensuring reproducibility and collaborative review. It includes considerations for ethical implications, screening controversies, and public health impact.
