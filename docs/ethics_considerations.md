# Ethics Considerations for Cancer Therapy Analysis

## 1. Data Privacy and Confidentiality
- Use only de-identified patient data.
- Ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) depending on the data source.
- Store sensitive data in secure, access-controlled environments.

## 2. Informed Consent
- For novel therapies (e.g., nanoparticle therapy), ensure that clinical trial participants provided informed consent for data sharing and secondary analysis.
- Consider whether consent covers the specific analyses being performed.

## 3. Equity and Accessibility
- Discuss the accessibility of high-cost treatments: are they available to diverse socioeconomic groups?
- Consider geographic disparities in access to novel therapies.
- Evaluate whether the therapy exacerbates existing health inequities.

## 4. Conflict of Interest
- Disclose any funding sources or affiliations that may bias the analysis.
- If the analysis is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, maintain transparency.

## 5. Publication Ethics
- Report negative or inconclusive results to avoid publication bias.
- Follow reporting guidelines (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE) for clinical data analysis.
- Ensure proper attribution of data sources.

## 6. Patient-Centered Outcomes
- Include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) when available.
- Respect patient preferences and values in interpreting results.

## 7. Regulatory Considerations
- New therapies may have different regulatory pathways (e.g., FDA accelerated approval).
- Discuss the implications of regulatory status on clinical adoption.
