# Results Directory

Store analysis outputs, visualizations, and tables generated by the scripts.

## Expected Outputs

- `figures/`: Plots (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves, forest plots, bar charts)
- `tables/`: Statistical tables (e.g., summary statistics, regression results)
- `models/`: Saved model objects (e.g., pickled classifiers, survival models)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates or version tags:

- `km_curve_nanoparticle_vs_control_20251230.png`
- `response_rates_table.csv`
- `cox_model_v1.pkl`

## Documentation

Each output file should be referenced in the final report with a brief description of what it shows and its interpretation.

## Version Control

Consider whether large binary files should be tracked with Git. Use `.gitignore` to exclude large intermediate files if necessary.
