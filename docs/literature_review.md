## Study Topic: Efficacy of [New Cancer Therapy] vs. Existing Treatments

### 1. Introduction
Briefly describe the cancer type, current standard of care, and the new therapy (e.g., nanoparticle therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy). State the research question: Does the new therapy improve outcomes compared to existing treatments?

### 2. Search Strategy
- **Databases searched**: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, etc.
- **Search terms**: e.g., "nanoparticle therapy AND [cancer type]", "clinical trial AND [therapy name]"
- **Inclusion criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, observational studies with comparison groups, meta-analyses.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Preclinical studies, case reports, non-English articles.

### 3. Summary of Key Papers
Use the table below to summarize each relevant study.

| Study (Author, Year) | Design | Sample Size | Intervention | Comparator | Primary Outcome | Key Findings | Limitations |
|----------------------|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Example: Smith et al. 2023 | RCT | n=300 | Nanoparticle therapy + chemo | Chemo alone | Overall survival | HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.50-0.85) | Single-center, short follow-up |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |

### 4. Synthesis of Evidence
- **Overall trend**: Does the evidence support superiority/non-inferiority of the new therapy?
- **Consistency**: Are findings consistent across studies?
- **Gaps**: Identify gaps in the literature (e.g., lack of long-term data, underrepresented populations).

### 5. Implications for Current Analysis
- Which outcomes will be analyzed in this project?
- How will the new therapy be compared (e.g., survival, response rates, quality of life)?
- Which statistical methods will be used (e.g., Cox regression, logistic regression)?

### 6. References
List full citations of the papers reviewed (APA or Vancouver style).
